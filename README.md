# Animal Shelter Foster Management

## Industry

Non-Profit / Veterinary Operations

## Expensive Problem

**Inventory Loss** and **Liability**.

Shelters lose thousands in crates and food sent to foster homes, and lost medical records can lead to sick animals returning to the shelter.

## Solution (MVP)

- **Foster Supply Checkout:** Tracks inventory (food, crates, meds) lent to foster parents.
- **Medical Continuity Log:** Foster parents log meds and behavior, creating a permanent digital paper trail.
- **Animal Profile Database:** Centralized source of truth for medical history and temperament.

## Business Value

Reduces inventory loss and helps ensure medical compliance (**Risk Management**).
